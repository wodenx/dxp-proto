          ### Overview

          Knapsack provides designers and developers with a set of tools that
          help with the creation of design

          systems, which can be used to maintain consistency across an entire
          application or website.

          Furthermore, the tools provided by Knapsack are designed to be easy to
          use, while also being highly

          flexible, allowing designers and developers to tailor them to their
          specific needs.


          One of the key benefits of Knapsack is its ability to facilitate
          collaboration between designers

          and developers. By providing designers with a set of tools that are
          designed to work closely with

          code, Knapsack allows for more efficient communication between
          designers and developers, which can

          help to reduce the amount of back-and-forth that is typically required
          during the design and

          development process.


          ### Components

          The current Knapsack space consists of four components, all of which
          are documented under the

          components tab:


          - Accordions

          - Buttons

          - Cards

          - Typography

          ######

          Each of these components has a number of variations, which are
          designed to be highly customizable,

          allowing designers and developers to create designs that are both
          consistent and unique.
