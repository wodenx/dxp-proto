# __dxp__

Starter site for Kenvue Digital Experience Platform.

## Local Development

### Install, Build, Serve

`npm i && npm run build && npm run serve`
Visit site on `localhost:9000`

### Running Stackbit

In one terminal `npm run dev`
Wait for dev site to load on `localhost:8000`
In a second terminal `npm run stackbit`
Visit `localhost:8092/_stackbit`

Note you can also run stackbit without running the dev site (of course you won't
get the preview or inline editing, but can be useful for testing models in the
sidebar).

### Running Bodiless Editor

Comment out `BODILESS_DISABLE_EDITOR=1` in `.env.site`
`npm run edit` from `sites/__dxp__`
> Be sure not to commit the change to `.env.site`

## Deployment

### Vercel

Import the GitHub repo and provide the following settings:
- Framework Preset: `Other`
- Build command `cd ../.. && npm run build`
- Install command `npm ci --prefix ../..`
- Root Directory `sites/__dxp__`
- Output Directory: `./public`

### Netlify / Gatsby Cloud

Import the GitHub repo and provide the following setting:
- Gatsby Root Folder: `sites/__dxp__`

> Note that Gatsby will scan `gatsby-config.js` and suggest that you set some
> environment variables. These must be removed from the "Environment Variables"
> section. Not removing them will cause them to have empty values which override
> the actual values from `.env.site`.

### Stackbit

Create new project -> Create from Github -> Use my repository
Leave all settings at defaults.
On second screen, delete all env vars.

Stackbit will create a `preview` branch in the repository, and Studio will always
run on this branch.  It must be kept manually in sync with `main`.

### Troubleshooting

If you receive error "npm ERR! [turbo] Failed to find package "turbo-darwin-64" on the file system"
1. run `git clean -xfd && npm i`
2. If still unresolved: run `npm i turbo`
